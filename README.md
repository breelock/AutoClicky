## Features
- In new combat system mode, Autoclicky will click exactly on the timing when the weapon's cooldown is over to do a lot of damage
- To switch between 1.8 and 1.9+ PvP systems, simply click the `New combat (1.9+)` or `Old combat (1.8)` button at the top
- Left and right mouse button autoclicker
- A clever auto jump that jumps before hitting and always deals critical damage
- Only entities allow you to click only when the player targets the entity. If you disable this feature, the autoclicker will work before you disable it
- You can change the delay between presses, and you can also set it to a randomized delay
- The logic of the keystrokes is the same as if you were actually pressing the keys.
- Multi-language support: English, Russian, Ukrainian

## How to use
- Open the settings with `N`
- Use `R` to toggle the left mouse button autoclicker
- Use `V` to toggle the right mouse button autoclicker
- Use `H` to switch between the new or old combat system
- You can change all of these keys in the minecraft control settings
